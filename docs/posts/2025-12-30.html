    I’ve been thinking a lot about how I spend my days. They don’t look the way I imagined they would, and that’s unsettling. I stay busy- working out, reading, learning- but busyness isn’t the same as progress. It’s possible to do many things and still avoid the one thing that matters. I’ve learned that distraction often wears the mask of discipline. <br><br>

The truth is simple: the work I want to do feels overwhelming, and so I substitute it with work that feels manageable. Moderately difficult tasks give the illusion of momentum. Truly important ones demand commitment, risk, and the willingness to be uncomfortable. Avoiding them doesn’t make the fear go away; it only makes the days blur together. <br><br>

So I’m choosing a different approach. Every day, I’ll write a short essay, 200-400 words, about a product idea. Sometimes it will be mine, sometimes it won’t. On weekends, I’ll go deeper and write something longer. Writing forces clarity. It turns vague ambition into concrete thought. I’ll create simple landing pages, test demand, and pay attention to what people respond to. When an idea shows promise, I’ll build the smallest possible version of it and put it into the world. Not because it’s perfect, but because “artists ship”. <br><br>

I don’t know where this leads. But I know this: progress doesn’t come from waiting to feel ready. It comes from deciding what matters and aligning your days with that decision. I’d rather risk failure building something meaningful than succeed at something that doesn’t matter to me at all. <br><br>

That feels like the right place to start.
