Failure isn’t usually about the idea. It’s almost always about the execution—and the timing. <br><br>

On paper, the FORM lifting collar was beautiful. A familiar object. A hidden accelerometer. Data about force, velocity, bar path. It felt inevitable. And yet, it failed. Not because lifters didn’t want insight—but because the product forgot who it was for. <br><br>

Great products start with empathy. Not technology. FORM started with sensors and worked backward. It asked athletes to trust numbers they couldn’t feel, metrics they didn’t yet understand, and accuracy they couldn’t verify. When data disagrees with your body, your body wins every time. <br><br>

The second problem was focus. Weightlifting is brutally simple. Add weight. Move it well. Repeat. The best tools respect that simplicity. FORM tried to turn a barbell into a laboratory instrument. Too much abstraction. Too much explanation. When a product needs a tutorial before it delivers value, you’ve already lost half your audience. <br><br>

Then there’s truth. Accelerometers are powerful—but physics is unforgiving. Measuring force and bar path from a single point on a barbell is hard. Really hard. Small errors compound. When results feel inconsistent, trust evaporates. And once trust is gone, no app update can bring it back. <br><br>

Price mattered too—but not the way people think. Athletes will pay for anything that clearly makes them better. They won’t pay for uncertainty. FORM didn’t cross that emotional threshold where the benefit is obvious after the first rep. <br><br>

The saddest part? The form factor was right. The ambition was right. But the product tried to prove value instead of revealing it. <br><br>

The lesson is simple and timeless: technology doesn’t succeed because it’s clever. It succeeds because it disappears. Until performance data feels as intuitive as gravity, it will always feel like an accessory—not a necessity. <br><br>

And great products are never accessories.
