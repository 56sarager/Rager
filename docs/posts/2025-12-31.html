    For the last decade, social apps have told us the same story. Brighter colors. Infinite scroll. Notifications designed to pull you back in, again and again. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok aren’t built around human well-being- they’re built around attention. They create false expectations, reward comparison, and quietly train us to measure our worth in likes and views. And for a generation already struggling with anxiety, especially social anxiety, the cost has been real. <br><br>

We decided to build something different. <br><br>

This app doesn’t try to keep you hooked. It doesn’t want to be your identity. It’s not chasing dopamine or engagement metrics. In fact, it’s designed to disappear as quickly as possible. You open it, you get a conversation starter chosen by someone around you, and then you put your phone away. The real product isn’t the screen- it’s the moment that happens after.
The design reflects that philosophy. It’s simple. Beige. Almost boring. No flashy animations. No endless feeds. No pressure to perform. Because when technology gets loud, people get quiet. And when technology steps back, people step forward. <br><br>

At its core, CONVO is about removing friction from real life. Starting a conversation shouldn’t feel like a performance or a risk. For someone with social anxiety, that first sentence can feel impossible. So we focused on that exact moment- the pause, the hesitation- and built a tool that gently helps you cross it. <br><br>

This isn’t social media. There are no followers. No filters. No version of yourself to maintain. Just a small, thoughtful prompt that helps two real people talk. <br><br>

The best technology doesn’t demand your attention. It earns your trust. And sometimes, the most powerful thing software can do is know when to get out of the way. <br><br>

That’s what we’re building: technology that respects your time, your mind, and your humanity. Not addictive. Not flashy. Just human.
